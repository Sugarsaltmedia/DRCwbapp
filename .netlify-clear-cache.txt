IMPORTANT: Clear Netlify Build Cache Before Deploying!

Your project previously used Supabase but now uses Firebase only.
Netlify may have cached the old Supabase dependencies.

To fix deployment issues:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Build Settings
3. Click "Clear cache and retry deploy"

OR use CLI:
   netlify build --clear-cache

This ensures Netlify rebuilds everything from scratch without old Supabase packages.
